While you are making the bot, you shall use State to avoid:

Imagine you just add a new handler like @dp.message(). After you get the phone number, the user sends their email. 
It works! But what if the user sends /start, gets the phone number prompt, and then just types "hello"? Y
our new handler would fire and try to save "hello" as an email, which is wrong.
You need a way for your bot to know that it is specifically waiting for an email. This "waiting for" status is called a state.

**The Solution: Finite State Machine (FSM)**

Think of FSM as giving your bot a short-term memory. You define a set of states for your conversation, and you can move the user from one state to another.
Here’s the process:
Define States: Create a class that lists all the steps in your conversation (e.g., WaitingForEmail).
Enter a State: After getting the phone number, you'll tell the bot, "Now, enter the WaitingForEmail state for this user."
Create a State-Specific Handler: Create a new handler that only triggers if the user is in the WaitingForEmail state.
Process Data and Exit State: Once you receive the email, you save it and then clear the state, bringing the conversation back to normal.


First, you need to import FSMContext for managing the state and State, StatesGroup for defining them. 
Then, create a class for your registration process.



While you are pushing to github, use hiding or .env to hid the token of your bot.

When you make handlers, do not forget make function async!
